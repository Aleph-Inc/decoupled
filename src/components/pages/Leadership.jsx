                  Motivating and Helpful Structures for Involved Christians
                </h2>
                <p>
                  We all want GO 2020 to involve as many Christians as possible
                  and be implemented in the best way possible. The existing
                  structures of partners in Go 2020 should carry the main weight
                  of the actual implementation. However, some additional
                  structure can help, in case it doesn’t unduly restrict or
                  demotivate the involvement. These additional structures are
                  intended to multiply scope and effectiveness and to inform,
                  involve, equip and empower Christians.

                <p>
                  GO 2020 is meant to be more like a movement than an
                  organization. Every church, denomination and ministry can
                  participate in its own way. A “light” and dynamic
                  organizational structure is facilitating a broad
                  participation.

                <p>
                  With “inspiring motivation” it usually proves very helpful to
                  form “operations boards” and/or “task forces” consisting of
                  key leaders from denominations, minis­tries, etc. which are
                  actively implementing the evangelistic emphasis. We expect
                  those kind of structures will be even more helpful in a
                  one-month-long emphasis.
