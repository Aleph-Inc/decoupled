                  Global Outreach Day has sought to be a movement from its

                  The Lord has used various denomina-tions, ministries, local
                  churches and networks to mobilize their constituencies to be
                  involved. The movement has grown because many partners have
                  owned the vision and the implementation and have utilized
                  their structures to motivate, equip, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Global Outreach Day (G.O.D.) contemplates broadening the
                  focus in 2020 from a day to a month, the movement will need to
                  continue to involve partners who own and implement among their
                  respective members, in their own way and using their own
                  strategies, trainings and materials where possible. The G.O.D.
                  his¬torical evangelistic emphases have generally had two
                  organizational components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To inspire mobilization</li>
                  <li>To facilitate implementation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  It seems reasonable to assume and project that GO 2020 will
                  have those as well.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>To Inspire Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                  G.O.D. leadership only has so much time and credibility to
                  inspire/motivate all segments of the Body of Christ.
                  Therefore, it is very helpful to find influential leaders who
                  share the vision and endorse the movement to their
                  organizations and beyond. These same people have a great deal
                  of wisdom/advice to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most often it has proven helpful to form “advisory boards”
                  made up of a number of these advisors and en-dorsers. GO 2020
                  has already formed a Global Advisory Board and is working
                  toward establishing similar groups at the continental and
                  national levels, as needed.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>To Facilitate Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                  In the past G.O.D. emphases we have found that as momentum
                  builds, there is great merit for those involved to be
                  encouraged and informed by what others are doing. A key word
                  to summarize this is “sharing”. Participating organizations
                  can help one another by sharing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Stories about what God is doing in the respective
                    organizations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Strategies, trainings and materials which seem to be working
                    well.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Plans, including major events, which may prove helpful for
                  other organizations to be involved in.
