                    Various outreaches in parks, streets and from home to home
                    took place in Kansas City during Global Outreach Day. "We
                    hosted six outreaches in parks throughout Kansas City," says
                    Rachel Lee, Global Outreach Day coordinator. "We had a kids
                    ministry truck with a stage and various people do
                    evangelism. We also had about 500 people going door to door
                    in Grandview. We visited 1,600 homes and distributed 5,000
                    pieces of material." "I Am Second" donated New Testament
                    Bibles and "Every Home for Christ" provided tracts. "Over
                    10,000 DVDs of the Jesus Film were donated to us in 16
                    different languages to reach non-English speaking people in
                    Kansas City," says Lee. "We recorded 250 prayers for
                    salvation." Micke Bickle from International House of Prayer
                    and his wife, Diane, were part of the team that went door to
                    door witnessing in Grandview, a suburb of Kansas City.

                    <em>Ten thousand</em> churches participated in Global
                    Outreach Day in India. Some networks expanded it to a
                    “Global Outreach Week”, sending out believers two by two to
                    unreached villages.
                  </p>

                  <p>Here is one summarized report from Northern India:</p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>9,231 </strong>- Villages were reached.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>3,360,025</strong> – Gospel tracks were distributed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>734,682 </strong>- People they said we want to
                    believe in Jesus.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We are looking forward to starting
                    <strong>3,153 new house churches</strong> in the next few
                    months, because we have found the “persons of peace.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We are looking forward to potentially
                    <strong>baptizing 70,000 people</strong> during July –
                    November in about 2,000 different places.

                    One particular Guru from the highest caste was very open to
                    the Gospel message. After he was prayed for, he gave his
                    life to Jesus––directly by the Ganges River!

                    “Global Outreach Day was a great blessing to our
                    neighborhood because we (a group of 19 girls from a boarding
                    home, age 12-19) could share the Gospel of Jesus many times
                    to many people. God equipped us and did His work through us.
                    We shared the story which we practiced in our weekly
                    gospel-class, and we gave away a few Bibles to those who
                    were willing to start reading about Jesus Christ the Savior.
                    Many of these young people did something they never thought
                    they were able to. God gave courage and took away all doubt
                    or fear. Praise be to Him!”

                    A pastor was evangelizing in a hospital in Lima and met a
                    man who had survived a gang war. He told him about Jesus,
                    and the man broke down in tears and got his life straight
                    with God. The following day, the pastor saw this man on the

                    criminals in the entire country and was named “Dracula”. His

                    In Uganda Global Outreach Day stirred up an ongoing movement
                    of ten thousand of believers who reach out every month to
                    share the Good News. It also launched a church planting
                    movement especially targeting rural areas. Denominations
                    that haven't planted churches for many years are focused now
                    in church planting.
